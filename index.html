  <p class="style1"><strong>Dear Friend,</strong></p>
  <p class="style64">People say that making finding motivation is hard... but that is not the case because only people who have a 
    defeatist mindset would say that.</p>
  <p class="style65">However, if you have great difficulties in getting and 
    staying motivated, I can honestly tell you that there is something wrong with the way you are thinking... and that is why it is very hard for you to make any real 
    progress in becoming inspired.</p>
  <p class="style65">No matter how many motivational courses you attend, it will still not be good enough for you because of the mindset!</p>
  <p class="style65">How long must one fail over and over again because they do not understand that their minds are attracting failure?</p>
  <p class="style65">It is time to look at the problem straight in the face...</p>
  <p align="center" class="style66"><span class="style18"><img src="images/1.png" /></span></p>
  <p class="style65"><strong>Let me show you what happens when you have a 
    lack of inspiration...</strong> <br />
  </p>
  <p class="style65">Lack of motivation and lack of enthusiasm are among the 
    main reasons for failure and of living a mediocre life. </p>
  <p class="style65">Individuals lacking in motivation and enthusiasm are 
    commonly passive, blame everything and everybody for their state of 
    affairs, and often come up with a lot of excuses why they shouldn&#39;t or 
    cannot do this or that.</p>
  <p class="style65">And this is just the beginning...</p>
  <p class="style65">It doesn't stop here because...</p>
  <p align="center" class="style66"><span class="style18"><img src="images/2.png" /></span></p>
  <p class="style65">Are you currently facing these problems:</p>
  <p class="style65">- Lack of faith in your abilities....</p>
  <p class="style65">- Laziness....</p>
  <p class="style65">- Being too stressed or nervous!</p>
  <p class="style65">- Lack of enough interest?</p>
  <p class="style65">- Absence of enough stimuli or incentives?</p>
  <p class="style65">No wonder people do not succeed in obtaining inspiration 
    in their lives! There are so many negative forces pulling people back!</p>
  <p class="style65">It is very sad to see people living a sub-standard life because of 
    lack of inspiration.</p>
  <p class="style65">But what if you can change everything?</p>
  <p class="style65">What if you have a shot at changing your outlook on life 
    and your success?</p>
  <p align="center" class="style66"><span class="style18"><img src="images/2.png" /></span></p>
  <p align="left" class="style65">Think about it... If you wish to improve 
    your life, you need to awaken motivation and enthusiasm. You need to 
    realize how much you lose by their absence, and how much you acquire by 
    having them.</p>
  <p align="left" class="style65">Are you ready to change your life?</p>
  <p align="left" class="style65">Check it out!</p>
  <p class="style43" align="left"><span class="style6">Introducing…</span><br />

  <p><span class="style66">What's really important now is NOT the pittance you'll invest in this book but how much you'll LOSE OUT if you don't!</span></p>
  <p class="style66">Understand that time and tide waits for no man (or woman).</p>
  <p class="style66">Don't let whatever considerations stand in the way between you and your success.</p>
  <p class="style66">You see, how much longer are must people learn the HARD WAY before investing in themselves?</p>
  <p class="style66">Think about how different your life could truly be if you really applied the strategies in these books. </p>
  <p class="style66">I cannot even begin to imagine someone who would not 
    take advantage of this - it's just scary!</p>
  <p class="style66">Thankfully, you are a sharp person... otherwise these things will not resonate with you.</p>
  <p class="style66">And to show my sincerity, I'll show you something that will definite sweeten the deal...</p>
